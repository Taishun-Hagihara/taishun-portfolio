# AGENTS.md

## Goal
I write the code myself. You (Codex) should mainly review, suggest improvements, and point out bugs.

## Rules
- Do NOT rewrite whole files unless I explicitly ask.
- When suggesting changes, explain: (1) why, (2) minimal diff idea, (3) what to test.
- JavaScript only (no TypeScript).
- Keep UI minimal and responsive.

## Commands
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
